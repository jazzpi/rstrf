# v0.1.1

This is a patch release that focuses on improvements for STRF workflows that
involve long recordings and large TLE catalogs.

Thanks a lot to the people in
[`#satnogs`](https://matrix.to/#/#satnogs:matrix.org) (and especially
`@cat:nannk.xyz`) for testing this and providing test data!

## Changes

- be more lenient with inconsistent spectrogram slice lengths (these are
  generated by `rffft` running on live data)
- support TLEs with Alpha-5 NORAD IDs
- be more tolerant for partially-invalid TLE catalogs
- support spectrograms that are too large for a single GPU buffer
- various performance optimizations
